STANDARD DISCLAIMER: Unlike most people who commit code to github, my 
primary motivation is simply to find a place for interesting code to live 
if I don't want to lose track of it.  You'll find my coding styles vary 
from project to project and that I pay little attention to community 
standards or feedback.  I do all that stuff at my day job.  Enjoy!  

This powershell script was conceived to help with RedTeam pivoting activities by
consolidating a large collection of click scripts into a single, cohesive series 
of commands that augment the powershell interpreter.
